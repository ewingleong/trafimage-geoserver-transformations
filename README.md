Geoserver rendering transformation for feature aggregation. 
See internal issue #14080071

# General

In the context of the Trafimage geoportal (http://maps.trafimage.ch/)of the swiss railway company SBB geOps was given the task to visualize events and activities along the train tracks. These include planned, ongoing and finished construction work, maintenance tasks and information on equipment along the tracks.

The data to be visualized has a very high information density which makes it challenging to create a visualization without sacrificing much information. Luckily GeoServer supports using WPS processes to be used during the rendering of a map in a WMS request under the name of Rendering Transformations (http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/styling/sld-extensions/rendering-transform.html). This feature allows a more complex styling than what is possible using SLD alone by allowing the implementer to modify the features in the rendering pipeline or even draw them on the image of the map directly. We decided to use the approach of the vector-to-vector transformations to be able to modify the incoming geodata and still benefit of GeoServer's rich styling abilites for vector data.

The visualization is based on the whole track network being split into segments based according to the data which will be visualized. There are similar line segments for each event/activity-type at a track. These line segments are then grouped by their geometry and then drawn at an offset parallel to the train tracks. The offset, color as well as the width of these resulting ribbons show the type as well as importance of the visualized event.

There are custom transformations for just stacking line segments along a track as well as for aggregating segments based on their attributes to acheive a weighting by drawing the width of the line in proportion to how many features are part of the aggregation. All of these WPS processes have a high configurability to allow reuse in other contexts.

# Installation

## Building the extension

Run

    make build
    
The generated JARs will be in the `target/` directory.


## Installing into Geoserver

This extension depends on the WPS extension which needs to be installed first. See 
http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/extensions/wps/install.html on this topic.

To install this extension, drop all JARs of the `target` directory to geoservers WEB-INF/lib/ directory and 
restart geoserver. The `target` directory will also contain the dependencies which are not already bundled with
geoserver.

To see if the installation was successful you may check if the rendering transformations 
as WPS services. Just go to "Demos" -> "WPS request builder". The rendering transformations
should be available in the "Choose Process" select box. The names are 

* "gs:AggregateSimilarFeatures"
* "gs:AggregateSimilarLinesAsPolygon"
* "gs:AggregateAsLineStacks"
* "gs:MakeOffsettedLines"

There is also a special "About Trafimage Rendering Transformations" page in "About & Status" 
menu which lists the version of the extension installed.

# Styling examples

For the SLD code for all examples see the examples directory. Documentation on the 
parameters of the rendering transformations is available in the "WPS request builder"
and in the source files.

Make sure you have an index on the geometries as this will speed up the aggregation significantly.

## Scripting with Javascript

Not all processes support javascript. For detailed info on a process see the "Processes" section.

### Environment

In the javascript environment the following objects are defined:

The `console` object has the following methods:

`log`: This method takes a String as argument and logs its value to the geoserver log on the "INFO" loglevel. Please do not leave too verbose logging calls in production code as these will slow down rendering significantly.

`error`: This method takes a String as argument and logs its value to the geoserver log on the "ERROR" loglevel. Please do not leave too verbose logging calls in production code as these will slow down rendering significantly.

### AggregateAsLineStacks

#### Javascript

It is possible to pass a script to the rendering transformation using the `renderScript` parameter of the transformation.

The script must define a `getFeatureWith` function. This function is called to get the width of a stack in pixels. The function recieves two parameters: the length of the line in map units (float value) and the number of features in the stack (integer value). The function must return a number.

It is possible to pass two values from the SLD to the javascript using the `scriptCustomVariable1` and `scriptCustomVariable2` parameters of the rendering transformation. This will create the corresponding global javascript variables `customVariable1` and `customVariable2`. These variable will be created AFTER the initial evaluation of the script, so the should only be accessed from inside the functions called by the rendering transformation.

Using these custom variables allows for example to pass the scale denominator to the script:

            <ogc:Function name="parameter">
              <ogc:Literal>scriptCustomVariable1</ogc:Literal>
              <ogc:Function name="env">
                <ogc:Literal>wms_scale_denominator</ogc:Literal>

              <ogc:Literal>
               
              var maxLineWidth = 20;
              var minLineWidth = 8;
                
              function getFeatureWith(featureLength, aggCount) {
                console.log("featureLength="+featureLength
                  +" aggCount="+aggCount
                  +" wms_scale_denominator (customVariable1)="+customVariable1
                  +" useless stuff (customVariable2)="+customVariable2
                );
                
                var width = Math.min(Math.max(minLineWidth, aggCount), maxLineWidth);
                return width;
               }
              </ogc:Literal>
